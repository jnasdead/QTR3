			<td>Beauty and The Beast (2017)</td>
			<td>This movie is a live action film of Disney's Beauty and The Beast 1991 animated version. It tells about a tale of a normal village girl who yearns for adventure and a better life. Her father goes missing on a trip so she goes after to find him, stumbling across a beast who would soon be revealed to be a prince. The prince was cursed to be a beast unless he has a true love's kiss before all the petals on a special rose falls. This movie touched my heart as it is one of my favorite films to watch over and over again. The scenery is majestic and it really does bring fairytales to life. The moral of the story is to never judge a book by its cover.</td>

			<td>Cinderella (2015)</td>
			<td>This live action is derived from its original 1950 Walt Disney animated movie. This shows a young girl who lived in a very happy family, she couldn't ask for anything more in her life. As time passed, her mother eventually fell ill and her last words to her were "Be kind Ella, and have courage". After a few months, her father found a new love interest named Lady Tremaine. Lady Tremaine had two daughters. Her father was called to go on a business trip, but he never came back. It was because he passed away from a horrible accident. Ella's stepfamily mistreated her but she still took her kindness and gave it to them. She worked for them and toiled and at the end, she got to marry her prince. This teaches people to be kind and persevere, and to always follow their dreams.</td>

			<td>Maleficent (2019)</td>
			<td>The first movie shows Maleficent's perspective and how she came to be a villain because of selfish humans. The second movie is about guiding Aurora as she weds her prince, but the prince's family despised Maleficent and planned to kill her. Though Maleficent didn't die she came back with her people and fought a war against the inhumane royals.</td>
